# ONGO E-commerce Website

## Overview

ONGO is a Swedish retail website built as a product showcase and store locator platform. The application serves as a digital storefront that inspires customers to visit physical stores rather than facilitating online purchases. It features product categories, campaigns, and a comprehensive store finder for locations from GÃ¶teborg to Sundsvall.

The application is built with modern web technologies including React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Express.js for the backend API, and uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for data management.
